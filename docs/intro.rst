The goal of this project is to create a platform for people (especially students) to learn, create and share
flashcards. There will be achievments, badges, duels and random pop-culture references.

Getting ready to develope
#########################

Our development setup includes VirtualBox, Vagrant and PyCharm and we use Heroku for deployment. See :ref:`Setting up a development environment` for a detailed guide.

What does Tsune mean?
#####################

    "Tsune is usually used in a more mundane context, such as brushing one’s teeth
    regularly. But in the martial arts it refers to a state of such complete assimilation and
    involvement that training becomes a natural and automatic part of one’s daily life.
    Before tsune is achieved, the student often must struggle to make the practice schedule fit
    into his everyday lifestyle; an endless number of factors will seem to hinder and obstruct
    one’s practice routine. Some people are never able to accommodate regular training, and
    thus never pass this stage.

    For those who persevere, however, tsune gradually takes over. A state is reached in
    which it is no longer necessary to think about disciplining one’s self to practice. The
    training becomes as automatic and as accepted as getting up in the morning, getting
    dressed and having breakfast. Now the feeling of awkwardness, the feeling that
    something is not right, comes only when a practice session is missed. At this point the
    martial artist has achieved a comfortable level of oneness with his art, and has fully
    integrated it into his life and his personality. This is also the happy situation which yields
    the greatest personal rewards. "
